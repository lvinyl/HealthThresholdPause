In a singleplayer (non-LAN) world, his plugin simply pauses the game if player health goes below a set threshold. If the player is in a multiplayer server, instead of pausing the game it will disconnect them from the server.

Commands:

/healthThreshold set <value> - Sets the health threshold

/healththreshold delay <value> - Sets the delay before pausing/disconnecting from the game

/healthThreshold current - Shows the current health threshold

/healthThreshold toggle - Toggles the mod

Keybinds:

H - Toggles the mod

Be advised that if you are the host of a LAN world, instead of saving and quitting the game, it will pause the game (the game will still run in the background and you will still take damage), so I apologize in advance since this is my first plugin.
